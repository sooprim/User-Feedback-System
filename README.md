## User Feedback System

This project was made with Next.js, which is a react-based web application, alongside using JSON server which simulates a backend.

## Getting Started

First, you will want to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```
Depending on your PC, you might need to install more dependencies. Then, you will run in one gitbash terminal:
```bash
npm run server
```
This is to have the JSON server up and running on port 5618 (my student ID).
Then, you will run in another gitbash terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the web application up and running.
