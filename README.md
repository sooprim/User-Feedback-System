## User Feedback System

This project was made with Next.js, which is a react-based web application that also utilizes bootstrap, alongside using JSON server which simulates a backend. The goal of this application is to let you display, create, update, and delete users, movies, and comments. There is more explanation and instructions in the homepage of the app.

## Getting Started

First, you will want to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm install -g json-server
```
Then, you will run in one gitbash terminal:
```bash
npm run server
```
Then, you will run in another gitbash terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will have both the backend and the frontend running simultaneously. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to begin.
